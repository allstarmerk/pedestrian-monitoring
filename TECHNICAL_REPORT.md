## 2. Privacy and Ethics

### 2.1 Privacy-Preserving Mechanisms

**Immediate Anonymization**
- MAC addresses hashed immediately upon detection
- SHA-256 with rotating cryptographic salt
- No raw MAC addresses stored anywhere in system
- Hash salt rotates every 7 days to prevent long-term tracking

**Stationary Device Filtering**
- Devices present >1 hour marked as stationary
- Excludes nearby homes, parked vehicles, fixed infrastructure
- Ensures only transient pedestrians analyzed
- Prevents unintentional residential monitoring

**Aggregated Analysis**
- Data aggregated into 4-hour windows
- Individual device tracking impossible
- No temporal linking of specific devices
- Focus on crowd-level patterns, not individuals

**No Sensitive Data Collection**
- No images or video
- No personal identifiers
- No location tracking beyond single point
- No device names or manufacturer data used

### 2.2 Regulatory Compliance

**GDPR Compliance**
- No personally identifiable information (PII) collected
- Data minimization principle followed
- Purpose limitation (traffic analysis only)
- Storage limitation (30-day raw data retention)
- Technical safeguards (encryption, hashing)

**Ethical Considerations**
- Transparent operation with public signage recommended
- Limited spatial scope (single metro station)
- Beneficial use case (public safety, urban planning)
- No commercial tracking or advertising purposes
- Open source and auditable code

### 2.3 Limitations and Boundaries

**What the System Can Do**
- Estimate aggregate crowd density
- Identify temporal traffic patterns
- Predict future congestion levels
- Support urban planning decisions

**What the System Cannot Do**
- Identify individual people
- Track specific devices over time (>7 days)
- Determine demographics or personal attributes
- Link detections to real identities
- Monitor beyond immediate vicinity

### 6.2 Solar Power Configuration

**Energy Calculation**
- Raspberry Pi 4: ~3W average (~600mAh at 5V)

**Wiring Setup**
1. Solar panel → USB output → Power bank input
2. Power bank output → Raspberry Pi USB-C power input
3. Enable pass-through charging on power bank
4. Power bank acts as UPS for nighttime operation

**Optimization Tips**
- Disable HDMI output: `sudo /opt/vc/bin/tvservice -o`
- Disable WiFi if using ethernet: `sudo iwconfig wlan0 txpower off`
- Reduce CPU governor: `sudo cpufreq-set -g powersave`
- Monitor: `vcgencmd get_throttled` (0x0 = no issues)

### 6.3 Weather Protection
